What is this all about
==============

We may or may not move from the existing site to one that we have more control over.

For the time being, we are doing contingency planning and that means getting an alternative set up and ready to go.

This github project is meant to track the issues, track any code changes, store assets, and all that good stuff.  

Right now it's just a shell.
